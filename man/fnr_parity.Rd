fnr_parity(
  data,

\arguments{
\item{data}{The dataframe that contains the necessary columns.}

\item{outcome}{The column name of the actual outcomes.}

\item{group}{Sensitive group to examine.}

\item{probs}{The column name or vector of the predicted probabilities (numeric between 0 - 1). If not defined, argument preds needs to be defined.}

\item{preds}{The column name or vector of the predicted binary outcome (0 or 1). If not defined, argument probs needs to be defined.}

\item{preds_levels}{The desired levels of the predicted binary outcome. If not defined, levels of the outcome variable are used.}

\item{outcome_base}{Base level for the target variable used to compute fairness metrics. Default is the first level of the outcome variable.}

\item{cutoff}{Cutoff to generate predicted outcomes from predicted probabilities. Default set to 0.5.}

\item{base}{Base level for sensitive group comparison}
}
\value{
\item{Metric}{Raw false negative rates for all groups and metrics standardized for the base group (false negative rate parity metric). Lower values compared to the reference group mean lower false negative error rates in the selected subgroups}
\item{Metric_plot}{Bar plot of False Negative Rate parity metric}
\item{Probability_plot}{Density plot of predicted probabilities per subgroup. Only plotted if probabilities are defined}
}
\description{
This function computes the False Negative Rate (FNR) parity metric
}
\details{
This function computes the False Negative Rate (FNR) parity metric as described by Chouldechova 2017. False negative rates are calculated
by the division of false negatives with all positives (irrespective of predicted values). In the returned
named vector, the reference group will be assigned 1, while all other groups will be assigned values
according to whether their false negative rates are lower or higher compared to the reference group. Lower
false negative error rates will be reflected in numbers lower than 1 in the returned named vector, thus numbers
lower than 1 mean BETTER prediction for the subgroup.
